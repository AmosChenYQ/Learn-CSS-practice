        <div>Living in this beautiful planet called Earth, I donâ€™t recall any earthling who had chosen the coordinates 
            where they were given life to. There are these colorful sheets called flags which determine the land that we can walk over. 
            The sky is surely in different colors in different coordinates and people see love in red, peace in green and death in gray. 
        </div>
        <div>
            As earthlings even our skin comes in variety of colors and some of us change colors during 
            summer time. The nature provides different shades of colors in different ways but surely a rainbow is one of the blessings of nature ðŸŒˆ. 
            Over the evolution weâ€™ve developed a common sense for colors and yet living in this digital era, colors are the main building blocks of communication and expression.
